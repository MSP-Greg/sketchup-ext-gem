Demo of communicating with a stand-alone Ruby from SketchUp

Starts a TCPServer in the stand-alone Ruby, and opens a connection in
SketchUp's embedded Ruby.

To start in SketchUp's Ruby console:
load '<path to file>/sub_start.rb'

After it's loaded, in SketchUp's Ruby console type:

SPR.send 'any text'

The text should be echoed.

To close the stand-alone Ruby:
SPR.close

Two environment setting are available.

ENV['SUB_PROCESS_RUBY']

Setting this to a valid ruby path will use it for the sub process Ruby.

ENV['SUB_PROCESS_DEBUG'] = 'true'

Setting this will enable debugging and also add the following methods:

SPR.env  - shows sub process ENV
SPR.gems - shows sub process gem info
SPR.lf   - shows sub process $LOADED_FEATURES
SPR.lp   - shows sub process $LOAD_PATH
